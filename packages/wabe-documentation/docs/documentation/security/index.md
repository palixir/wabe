# Permissions

Wabe allows you to manage permissions at multiple levels to achieve maximum granularity. You can manage them at the class level or at the object level.

## Class level permissions (CLP)

When configuring your class, you have the option to set specific access `permissions` for that class. These permissions allow you to specify rights for `creating`, `updating`, `deleting`, and `reading` the class data. For each of the four CRUD operations, you can define whether authentication is required to perform the operation and which roles are authorized to execute it for more granular control.

Here is an exempla of permissions settings for `Company` classes.

`Class-level permissions` are managed automatically by Wabe; you only need to define your class configuration as shown in the example below.

```ts
import { Wabe } from "wabe";
import { RoleEnum } from "../generated/wabe";

const run = async () => {
  const wabe = new Wabe({
    // ... others config fields
    authentication: {
      // We create one role named Admin
      roles: ["Admin"],
    },
    schema: {
      classes: [
        {
          name: "Company",
          fields: {
            name: {
              type: "String",
            },
            contactEmail: {
              type: "Email",
            },
          },
          permissions: {
            create: {
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
              requireAuthentication: true,
            },
            read: {
              requireAuthentication: false,
            },
            update: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
            delete: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();
```

## Access control lists (ACL)

`Access control lists` are much more granular. They allow, for example, an object to be read, modified, or deleted only by one or more specific users. A very simple use case is to prevent the deletion of a user by anyone except the user themselves.

To define an `access control list` you can use the default configuration that Wabe provides. It should cover most of the use cases but let know if you need something more specific. Here is an example :

```ts
import { Wabe } from "wabe";
import { RoleEnum } from "../generated/wabe";

const run = async () => {
  const wabe = new Wabe({
    // ... others config fields
    authentication: {
      // We create one role named Admin
      roles: ["Admin"],
    },
    schema: {
      classes: [
        {
          name: "Company",
          fields: {
            name: {
              type: "String",
            },
            contactEmail: {
              type: "Email",
            },
          },
          permissions: {
            create: {
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
              requireAuthentication: true,
            },
            read: {
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
              requireAuthentication: false,
            },
            update: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
            delete: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
            acl: async (hookObject) => {
              // The user that creataed the company is authorized to read and write it
              await hookObject.addACL('users', {
                userId: hookObject.context.user?.id,
                read: true,
                write: true,
              })

              // No roles are authorized to read or write the company
              await hookObject.addACL('roles', null)
              // Or you can specify a role
              await hookObject.addACL('roles', {
                role: RoleEnum.Admin,
                read: true,
                write: true,
              })
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();
```

If your use is more specific, you can create your own `hook` to set the acl on the class.

Here is an example of a `hook` that can be created to set acl on the class `Company` before creation.

```ts
// Hook on class Company beforeCreate
const setAclOnCompany = async (hookObject: HookObject<any, any>) => {
  hookObject.upsertNewData("acl", {
    // Array of users with access on read and write for each one
    users: [
      {
        userId: "userId",
        read: false,
        write: true,
      },
    ],
    // Array of roles with acces on read and write for each one
    roles: [
      {
        roleId: "roleId",
        read: true,
        write: true,
      },
    ],
  });
};
```

## Protected Field

The `protected` field allows you to define additional restrictions on read (`read`) and update (`update`) operations for specific fields within a class. By using this field, you can specify which roles are authorized to perform these operations, providing more granular control over data access.

### Usage

To use the `protected` field, you need to define it in the configuration of your class fields. This field accepts an array of roles that are permitted to read or update the field.

### Example

Here is an example configuration using the `protected` field to restrict access to certain fields:

```typescript
import { Wabe } from "wabe";
import { RoleEnum } from "../generated/wabe";

const run = async () => {
  const wabe = new Wabe({
    // ... other configuration fields
    authentication: {
      roles: ["Admin", "Client", "rootOnly"],
    },
    schema: {
      classes: [
        {
          name: "Company",
          fields: {
            name: {
              type: "String",
              protected: {
                authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin, RoleEnum.Client], // Only Admin and Client roles can read or update this field
                protectedOperations: ["read", "update"], // Only read and update operations are allowed for this field
              }
            },
            sensitiveInfo: {
              type: "String",
              protected: {
                authorizedRoles: ["rootOnly"], // Only root can read or update field
                protectedOperations: ["read", "update"], // Only read and update operations are allowed for this field
              }
            },
          },
          permissions: {
            create: {
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
              requireAuthentication: true,
            },
            read: {
              requireAuthentication: false,
            },
            update: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
            delete: {
              requireAuthentication: true,
              authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin],
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();

### Explanation

- **`authorizedRoles: [RoleEnum.Admin, RoleEnum.Client]`**: This setting indicates that only users with the `Admin` or `Client` roles will be affected by the `protected` field.
- **`protectedOperations: ["read", "update"]`**: This setting indicates that only read and update operations will be blocked for the field.

### Use Cases

- **Protecting Sensitive Data**: Use the `protected` field to restrict access to sensitive information to specific roles.
- **Granular Control**: Provide finer control over read and update operations at the individual field level.

By incorporating the `protected` field into your configuration, you can enhance the security of your application by limiting access to critical data to authorized users only.

## CORS

Wabe allows you to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control the access to your API. You can enable CORS by setting the `corsOptions` property in the `security` configuration object.

```ts
import { Wabe } from "wabe";

const run = async () => {
  const wabe = new Wabe({
    // ... others config fields
    security: {
      corsOptions: {
        origin: "http://localhost:3000",
        allowMethods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
        allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
        exposedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
        credentials: true,
        maxAge: 60,
      },
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();
```

## Rate limiting

Rate limiting is a security feature that allows you to limit the number of requests that can be made to your API within a certain time period. You can enable rate limiting by setting the `rateLimit` property in the `security` configuration object.

```ts
import { Wabe } from "wabe";

const run = async () => {
  const wabe = new Wabe({
    // ... others config fields
    security: {
      rateLimit: {
        interval: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
        numberOfRequests: 100, // 100 requests per minute
      },
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();
```
