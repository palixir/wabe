# Quick start

## Create backend project

For a quick start, we’ll assume you are beginning a new backend project. For simplicity (and also because Wabe was built with it), we will create the project using `Bun`. However, it's important to note that Wabe is also **compatible** with `Node`.

### Install bun

You can found more information [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation#installing).

```sh
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun # for macOS and Linux
or
npm install -g bun # for Windows
```

### Create project

Create the project with the `bun init` command.

```sh
bun init
```

Now you should have a basic project with an `index.ts` file.

## Create your first Wabe app

Let's first add the necessary wabe dependency.

```sh
bun add wabe
bun add --dev wabe-mongodb-launcher
```

Open the `index.ts` file and past the following code.

```ts
import { Wabe } from "wabe";
import { MongoAdapter } from "wabe-mongodb"
import { runDatabase } from 'wabe-mongodb-launcher'

const run = async () => {
  await runDatabase()

  const wabe = new Wabe({
    isProduction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    // Root key example (must be long minimal 64 characters, you can generate it online)
    rootKey:
      "0uwFvUxM$ceFuF1aEtTtZMa7DUN2NZudqgY5ve5W*QCyb58cwMj9JeoaV@d#%29v&aJzswuudVU1%nAT+rxS0Bh&OkgBYc0PH18*",
    database: {
      adapter: new MongoAdapter({
        databaseName: "WabeApp",
        url: "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27045",
      })
    },
    port: 3001,
    schema: {
      classes: [],
      scalars: [],
      enums: [],
      resolvers: {
        mutations: {},
        queries: {},
      },
    },
  });

  await wabe.start();
};

await run();
```

Let’s take a look at what’s happening in this small example. We’re creating a wabe object with minimal configuration.

- The first element is the `rootKey`, a string that should be as long and varied as possible, which can be included in all requests made to the API by passing it in the `Wabe-Root-Key` header. It grants root access to all requests. It must remain completely secret and should only be used by the backend itself; under no circumstances should it be shared with the frontend. The root key override all security checks.

- Next, we have the `database` information (the type of database; currently, Wabe only supports MongoDB, but support for Postgres is planned).

- We also see the `port` on which we’re launching the server.

- Finally, the `schema` object allows you to specify various elements (your backend classes, enums, scalars, and resolvers). We’ll explore all these elements in more detail in the next section dedicated to the schema.

You can now **run** the `index.ts` file with the following command `bun run index.ts`.

## Explore the GraphQL dashboard

Now that you’ve launched your first server with Wabe, you can go to the following address:

`http://localhost:3001/graphql`

You’ll arrive at a GraphiQL interface with an online playground that allows you to test queries (figure 1). Click on "Show documentation explorer" in the top left corner to access the second interface (figure 2).

![GraphQL Playground](/graphqlPlayground.webp)

In this interface, you’ll see that some queries are already created. By default, `Wabe` provides three classes: one class for users (with various elements, including authentication), a `Session` class to manage user sessions, and the last one corresponds to `Roles`. Any roles you create (see the Schema section) will be automatically added to the Role class and included in the RoleEnum enum.

![GraphQL Playground wiht all default resolvers](/graphqlPlayground2.webp)

For each class you define, two queries and six mutations will be automatically generated to allow you to interact with your data. This will be explained in more detail in the Schema section.
