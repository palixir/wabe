## What is Wabe?

Wabe is a powerful **Backend-as-a-Service** built with TypeScript that makes creating backends simple and fast. It handles the heavy lifting of backend development, providing an all-in-one solution that you can set up in minutes.

With Wabe, you get:

- **Automatic database management**
- **Authentication and security** with a flexible, multi-level permission system
- **GraphQL API generation** based on your schema
- **Hooks system** to run custom logic before or after database operations
- **Full customization**, including custom authentication methods, GraphQL resolvers, REST routes, enums, and scalars

Wabe is designed to be both **comprehensive and flexible**, so you can build exactly the backend your application needs.

## Why use Wabe?

Existing solutions often come with trade-offs:

- **Parse Server**: powerful but not TypeScript-friendly, with unclear documentation and limited evolution.
- **Supabase**: modern and easy, but limited in customization and complex workflows if you want no vendor lock-in and complex use case.

Wabe combines the **best of both worlds**:

- TypeScript-first approach for **type safety and developer confidence**
- Flexible architecture that lets you **extend, customize, and integrate** with anything
- A modern backend that scales with your application's needs

Whether you’re building a simple CRUD app or a complex system with custom GraphQL resolvers, Wabe provides the tools and flexibility to get it done faster and smarter.

Wabe is not just a backend—it’s a **powerful, customizable toolbox** that grows with your application.
