   *
   * If `terminal` is `true` for this instance then the `output` stream will get the best compatibility if it defines an `output.columns` property,
   * and emits a `'resize'` event on the `output`, if or when the columns ever change (`process.stdout` does this automatically when it is a TTY).
   *
   * ## Use of the `completer` function
   *
   * The `completer` function takes the current line entered by the user as an argument, and returns an `Array` with 2 entries:
   *
   * - An Array with matching entries for the completion.
   * - The substring that was used for the matching.
   *
   * For instance: `[[substr1, substr2, ...], originalsubstring]`.
   *
   * ```js
   * function completer(line) {
   *   const completions = '.help .error .exit .quit .q'.split(' ');
   *   const hits = completions.filter((c) => c.startsWith(line));
   *   // Show all completions if none found
   *   return [hits.length ? hits : completions, line];
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `completer` function can also returns a `Promise`, or be asynchronous:
   *
   * ```js
   * async function completer(linePartial) {
   *   await someAsyncWork();
   *   return [['123'], linePartial];
   * }
   * ```

// ./worker_threads.d.ts

/**
 * The `worker_threads` module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript
 * in parallel. To access it:
 *
 * ```js
 * const worker = require('worker_threads');
 * ```
 *
 * Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.
 * They do not help much with I/O-intensive work. The Node.js built-in
 * asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.
 *
 * Unlike `child_process` or `cluster`, `worker_threads` can share memory. They do
 * so by transferring `ArrayBuffer` instances or sharing `SharedArrayBuffer`instances.
 *
 * ```js
 * const {
 *   Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData
 * } = require('worker_threads');
 *
 * if (isMainThread) {
 *   module.exports = function parseJSAsync(script) {
 *     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *       const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
 *         workerData: script
 *       });
 *       worker.on('message', resolve);
 *       worker.on('error', reject);
 *       worker.on('exit', (code) => {
 *         if (code !== 0)
 *           reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
 *       });
 *     });
 *   };
 * } else {
 *   const { parse } = require('some-js-parsing-library');
 *   const script = workerData;
 *   parentPort.postMessage(parse(script));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The above example spawns a Worker thread for each `parseJSAsync()` call. In
 * practice, use a pool of Workers for these kinds of tasks. Otherwise, the
 * overhead of creating Workers would likely exceed their benefit.
 *
 * When implementing a worker pool, use the `AsyncResource` API to inform
 * diagnostic tools (e.g. to provide asynchronous stack traces) about the
 * correlation between tasks and their outcomes. See `"Using AsyncResource for a Worker thread pool"` in the `async_hooks` documentation for an example implementation.
 *
 * Worker threads inherit non-process-specific options by default. Refer to `Worker constructor options` to know how to customize worker thread options,
 * specifically `argv` and `execArgv` options.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/worker_threads.js)

     *
     * In particular, the significant differences to `JSON` are:
     *
     * * `value` may contain circular references.
     * * `value` may contain instances of builtin JS types such as `RegExp`s,`BigInt`s, `Map`s, `Set`s, etc.
     * * `value` may contain typed arrays, both using `ArrayBuffer`s
     * and `SharedArrayBuffer`s.
     * * `value` may contain [`WebAssembly.Module`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Module) instances.
     * * `value` may not contain native (C++-backed) objects other than:
     *
     * ```js
     * const { MessageChannel } = require('worker_threads');
     * const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();

     *
     * `transferList` may be a list of [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer), `MessagePort` and `FileHandle` objects.
     * After transferring, they are not usable on the sending side of the channel
     * anymore (even if they are not contained in `value`). Unlike with `child processes`, transferring handles such as network sockets is currently
     * not supported.
     *
     * If `value` contains [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) instances, those are accessible
     * from either thread. They cannot be listed in `transferList`.
     *
     * `value` may still contain `ArrayBuffer` instances that are not in`transferList`; in that case, the underlying memory is copied rather than moved.

     * const { MessageChannel } = require('worker_threads');
     * const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();
     *
     * port1.on('message', (message) => console.log(message));

     * // This posts a copy of `uint8Array`:
     * port2.postMessage(uint8Array);
     * // This does not copy data, but renders `uint8Array` unusable:
     * port2.postMessage(uint8Array, [ uint8Array.buffer ]);
     *
     * // The memory for the `sharedUint8Array` is accessible from both the
     * // original and the copy received by `.on('message')`:
     * const sharedUint8Array = new Uint8Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));
     * port2.postMessage(sharedUint8Array);
     *
     * // This transfers a freshly created message port to the receiver.
     * // This can be used, for example, to create communication channels between
     * // multiple `Worker` threads that are children of the same parent thread.
     * const otherChannel = new MessageChannel();
     * port2.postMessage({ port: otherChannel.port1 }, [ otherChannel.port1 ]);

   * The `Worker` class represents an independent JavaScript execution thread.
   * Most Node.js APIs are available inside of it.
   *
   * Notable differences inside a Worker environment are:
   *
   * * The `process.stdin`, `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` may be redirected by the parent thread.
   * * The `require('worker_threads').isMainThread` property is set to `false`.
   * * The `require('worker_threads').parentPort` message port is available.
   * * `process.exit()` does not stop the whole program, just the single thread,
   * and `process.abort()` is not available.
   * * `process.chdir()` and `process` methods that set group or user ids
   * are not available.
   * * `process.env` is a copy of the parent thread's environment variables,
   * unless otherwise specified. Changes to one copy are not visible in other
   * threads, and are not visible to native add-ons (unless `worker.SHARE_ENV` is passed as the `env` option to the `Worker` constructor).
   * * `process.title` cannot be modified.
   * * Signals are not delivered through `process.on('...')`.
   * * Execution may stop at any point as a result of `worker.terminate()` being invoked.
   * * IPC channels from parent processes are not accessible.
   * * The `trace_events` module is not supported.
   * * Native add-ons can only be loaded from multiple threads if they fulfill `certain conditions`.
   *
   * Creating `Worker` instances inside of other `Worker`s is possible.
   *
   * Like [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and the `cluster module`, two-way communication can be
   * achieved through inter-thread message passing. Internally, a `Worker` has a
   * built-in pair of `MessagePort` s that are already associated with each other
   * when the `Worker` is created. While the `MessagePort` object on the parent side
   * is not directly exposed, its functionalities are exposed through `worker.postMessage()` and the `worker.on('message')` event
   * on the `Worker` object for the parent thread.
   *
   * To create custom messaging channels (which is encouraged over using the default
   * global channel because it facilitates separation of concerns), users can create
   * a `MessageChannel` object on either thread and pass one of the`MessagePort`s on that `MessageChannel` to the other thread through a
   * pre-existing channel, such as the global one.
   *
   * See `port.postMessage()` for more information on how messages are passed,
   * and what kind of JavaScript values can be successfully transported through
   * the thread barrier.

   * final argument in all cases. If `original` is not a function, `promisify()`will throw an error. If `original` is a function but its last argument is not
   * an error-first callback, it will still be passed an error-first
   * callback as its last argument.
   *
   * Using `promisify()` on class methods or other methods that use `this` may not
   * work as expected unless handled specially:
   *
   * ```js
   * const util = require('util');
   *
   * class Foo {
   *   constructor() {
   *     this.a = 42;
   *   }
   *
   *   bar(callback) {
   *     callback(null, this.a);
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * const foo = new Foo();
   *
   * const naiveBar = util.promisify(foo.bar);
   * // TypeError: Cannot read property 'a' of undefined
   * // naiveBar().then(a => console.log(a));
   *
   * naiveBar.call(foo).then((a) => console.log(a)); // '42'
   *
   * const bindBar = naiveBar.bind(foo);
   * bindBar().then((a) => console.log(a)); // '42'

 * The `dns` module enables name resolution. For example, use it to look up IP
 * addresses of host names.
 *
 * Although named for the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), it does not always use the
 * DNS protocol for lookups. {@link lookup} uses the operating system
 * facilities to perform name resolution. It may not need to perform any network
 * communication. To perform name resolution the way other applications on the same
 * system do, use {@link lookup}.
 *
 * ```js
 * const dns = require('dns');
 *
 * dns.lookup('example.org', (err, address, family) => {
 *   console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family);
 * });
 * // address: "93.184.216.34" family: IPv4
 * ```
 *
 * All other functions in the `dns` module connect to an actual DNS server to
 * perform name resolution. They will always use the network to perform DNS
 * queries. These functions do not use the same set of configuration files used by {@link lookup} (e.g. `/etc/hosts`). Use these functions to always perform
 * DNS queries, bypassing other name-resolution facilities.
 *
 * ```js
 * const dns = require('dns');
 *
 * dns.resolve4('archive.org', (err, addresses) => {
 *   if (err) throw err;
 *
 *   console.log(`addresses: ${JSON.stringify(addresses)}`);

     * // thrown by the input function!
     * assert.throws(throwingFirst, 'Second');
     * // In the next example the message has no benefit over the message from the
     * // error and since it is not clear if the user intended to actually match
     * // against the error message, Node.js throws an `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT` error.
     * assert.throws(throwingSecond, 'Second');
     * // TypeError [ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT]

     *
     * ### Filter results to IPv4:

     * #### DNS resolver client
     *

     * - `c-ares` - Uses the c-ares library to perform DNS resolution. This is the default on Linux.
     * - `system` - Uses the system's non-blocking DNS resolver API if available, falls back to `getaddrinfo`. This is the default on macOS and the same as `getaddrinfo` on Linux.
     * - `getaddrinfo` - Uses the posix standard `getaddrinfo` function. Will cause performance issues under concurrent loads.
     *
     * To customize the DNS resolver, pass a `backend` option to `dns.lookup`:
     * ```js
     * import { dns } from 'bun';
     * const [{ address }] = await dns.lookup('example.com', {backend: 'getaddrinfo'});
     * console.log(address); // "19.42.52.62"

         * may change in a future version of Bun if c-ares is not reliable
         * enough.
         *
         * On macOS, `system` uses the builtin macOS [non-blocking DNS
         * resolution
         * API](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libinfo/Libinfo-222.1/lookup.subproj/netdb_async.h.auto.html).
         *
         * On Linux, `system` is the same as `getaddrinfo`.
         *
         * `c-ares` is more performant on Linux in some high concurrency
         * situations, but it lacks support support for mDNS (`*.local`,
         * `*.localhost` domains) along with some other advanced features. If
         * you run into issues using `c-ares`, you should try `system`. If the
         * hostname ends with `.local` or `.localhost`, Bun will automatically
         * use `system` instead of `c-ares`.
         *
         * [`getaddrinfo`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)
         * is the POSIX standard function for blocking DNS resolution. Bun runs
         * it in Bun's thread pool, which is limited to `cpus / 2`. That means
         * if you run a lot of concurrent DNS lookups, concurrent IO will
         * potentially pause until the DNS lookups are done.
         *
         * On macOS, it shouldn't be necessary to use "`getaddrinfo`" because
         * `"system"` uses the same API underneath (except non-blocking).

   * - `onLoad` lets you return source code or an object that will become the module's exports
   * - `onResolve` lets you redirect a module specifier to another module specifier. It does not chain.

/**
 * `Buffer` objects are used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. Many
 * Node.js APIs support `Buffer`s.
 *
 * The `Buffer` class is a subclass of JavaScript's [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) class and
 * extends it with methods that cover additional use cases. Node.js APIs accept
 * plain [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) s wherever `Buffer`s are supported as well.
 *
 * While the `Buffer` class is available within the global scope, it is still
 * recommended to explicitly reference it via an import or require statement.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
 *
 * // Creates a zero-filled Buffer of length 10.
 * const buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
 *
 * // Creates a Buffer of length 10,
 * // filled with bytes which all have the value `1`.
 * const buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10, 1);
 *
 * // Creates an uninitialized buffer of length 10.
 * // This is faster than calling Buffer.alloc() but the returned
 * // Buffer instance might contain old data that needs to be
 * // overwritten using fill(), write(), or other functions that fill the Buffer's
 * // contents.
 * const buf3 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);
 *
 * // Creates a Buffer containing the bytes [1, 2, 3].
 * const buf4 = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]);
 *
 * // Creates a Buffer containing the bytes [1, 1, 1, 1] – the entries
 * // are all truncated using `(value &#x26; 255)` to fit into the range 0–255.
 * const buf5 = Buffer.from([257, 257.5, -255, '1']);
 *
 * // Creates a Buffer containing the UTF-8-encoded bytes for the string 'tést':
 * // [0x74, 0xc3, 0xa9, 0x73, 0x74] (in hexadecimal notation)
 * // [116, 195, 169, 115, 116] (in decimal notation)
 * const buf6 = Buffer.from('tést');
 *
 * // Creates a Buffer containing the Latin-1 bytes [0x74, 0xe9, 0x73, 0x74].
 * const buf7 = Buffer.from('tést', 'latin1');

/**
 * A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
 * The `stream` module provides an API for implementing the stream interface.
 *
 * There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a `request to an HTTP server` and `process.stdout` are both stream instances.
 *
 * Streams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of `EventEmitter`.
 *
 * To access the `stream` module:
 *
 * ```js
 * const stream = require('stream');
 * ```
 *
 * The `stream` module is useful for creating new types of stream instances. It is
 * usually not necessary to use the `stream` module to consume streams.

       * ```
       *
       * A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from
       * a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the`size` argument.
       *
       * If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will
       * also be emitted.
       *
       * Calling {@link read} after the `'end'` event has

       * first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is
       * emitted.
       *
       * The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the`highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`.
       * If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should
       * stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.
       *
       * While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and
       * return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for
       * delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted.
       * Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks
       * until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that
       * is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until
       * maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally.
       * Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector
       * performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system,
       * even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never
       * drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is
       * not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.
       *
       * Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly
       * problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused
       * by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler
       * is added.
       *
       * If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is
       * recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use {@link pipe}. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is
       * possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:
       *
       * ```js
       * function write(data, cb) {
       *   if (!stream.write(data)) {
       *     stream.once('drain', cb);
       *   } else {
       *     process.nextTick(cb);
       *   }
       * }
       *
       * // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
       * write('hello', () => {
       *   console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
       * });
       * ```

       * @param chunk Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a string, `Buffer` or `Uint8Array`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any
       * JavaScript value other than `null`.

       * @param callback Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

     * ```
     *
     * To use an `AbortSignal`, pass it inside an options object,

     * const { pipeline } = require('stream/promises');
     * const fs = require('fs');
     *
     * async function run() {

     *         yield await processChunk(chunk, { signal });
     *       }
     *     },

     *   );
     *   console.log('Pipeline succeeded.');
     * }
     *
     * run().catch(console.error);
     * ```
     *
     * Remember to handle the `signal` argument passed into the async generator.
     * Especially in the case where the async generator is the source for the
     * pipeline (i.e. first argument) or the pipeline will never complete.
     *
     * ```js
     * const { pipeline } = require('stream/promises');
     * const fs = require('fs');
     *
     * async function run() {

     *   );
     *   console.log('Pipeline succeeded.');
     * }
     *
     * run().catch(console.error);
     * ```
     *
     * `stream.pipeline()` will call `stream.destroy(err)` on all streams except:
     *
     * * `Readable` streams which have emitted `'end'` or `'close'`.
     * * `Writable` streams which have emitted `'finish'` or `'close'`.
     *
     * `stream.pipeline()` leaves dangling event listeners on the streams
     * after the `callback` has been invoked. In the case of reuse of streams after
     * failure, this can cause event listener leaks and swallowed errors. If the last
     * stream is readable, dangling event listeners will be removed so that the last
     * stream can be consumed later.
     *
     * `stream.pipeline()` closes all the streams when an error is raised.
     * The `IncomingRequest` usage with `pipeline` could lead to an unexpected behavior
     * once it would destroy the socket without sending the expected response.
     * See the example below:
     *
     * ```js
     * const fs = require('fs');
     * const http = require('http');
     * const { pipeline } = require('stream');
     *
     * const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     *   const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('./fileNotExist.txt');
     *   pipeline(fileStream, res, (err) => {
     *     if (err) {
     *       console.log(err); // No such file
     *       // this message can't be sent once `pipeline` already destroyed the socket
     *       return res.end('error!!!');
     *     }
     *   });
     * });
     * ```
     * @param callback Called when the pipeline is fully done.

/**
 * The `zlib` module provides compression functionality implemented using Gzip,
 * Deflate/Inflate, and Brotli.
 *
 * To access it:
 *
 * ```js
 * const zlib = require('zlib');
 * ```
 *
 * Compression and decompression are built around the Node.js `Streams API`.
 *
 * Compressing or decompressing a stream (such as a file) can be accomplished by
 * piping the source stream through a `zlib` `Transform` stream into a destination
 * stream:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { createGzip } = require('zlib');
 * const { pipeline } = require('stream');
 * const {
 *   createReadStream,
 *   createWriteStream
 * } = require('fs');
 *
 * const gzip = createGzip();
 * const source = createReadStream('input.txt');
 * const destination = createWriteStream('input.txt.gz');
 *
 * pipeline(source, gzip, destination, (err) => {
 *   if (err) {
 *     console.error('An error occurred:', err);
 *     process.exitCode = 1;
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Or, Promisified
 *
 * const { promisify } = require('util');
 * const pipe = promisify(pipeline);
 *
 * async function do_gzip(input, output) {
 *   const gzip = createGzip();
 *   const source = createReadStream(input);
 *   const destination = createWriteStream(output);
 *   await pipe(source, gzip, destination);
 * }
 *
 * do_gzip('input.txt', 'input.txt.gz')
 *   .catch((err) => {
 *     console.error('An error occurred:', err);
 *     process.exitCode = 1;
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * It is also possible to compress or decompress data in a single step:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { deflate, unzip } = require('zlib');
 *
 * const input = '.................................';
 * deflate(input, (err, buffer) => {
 *   if (err) {
 *     console.error('An error occurred:', err);
 *     process.exitCode = 1;
 *   }
 *   console.log(buffer.toString('base64'));
 * });
 *
 * const buffer = Buffer.from('eJzT0yMAAGTvBe8=', 'base64');
 * unzip(buffer, (err, buffer) => {
 *   if (err) {
 *     console.error('An error occurred:', err);
 *     process.exitCode = 1;
 *   }
 *   console.log(buffer.toString());
 * });
 *
 * // Or, Promisified
 *
 * const { promisify } = require('util');
 * const do_unzip = promisify(unzip);
 *
 * do_unzip(buffer)
 *   .then((buf) => console.log(buf.toString()))
 *   .catch((err) => {
 *     console.error('An error occurred:', err);

 * **The version of the punycode module bundled in Node.js is being deprecated.**In a future major version of Node.js this module will be removed. Users
 * currently depending on the `punycode` module should switch to using the
 * userland-provided [Punycode.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js) module instead. For punycode-based URL
 * encoding, see `url.domainToASCII` or, more generally, the `WHATWG URL API`.
 *
 * The `punycode` module is a bundled version of the [Punycode.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js) module. It
 * can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * const punycode = require('punycode');
 * ```
 *
 * [Punycode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) is a character encoding scheme defined by RFC 3492 that is
 * primarily intended for use in Internationalized Domain Names. Because host
 * names in URLs are limited to ASCII characters only, Domain Names that contain
 * non-ASCII characters must be converted into ASCII using the Punycode scheme.
 * For instance, the Japanese character that translates into the English word,`'example'` is `'例'`. The Internationalized Domain Name, `'例.com'` (equivalent
 * to `'example.com'`) is represented by Punycode as the ASCII string`'xn--fsq.com'`.
 *
 * The `punycode` module provides a simple implementation of the Punycode standard.
 *
 * The `punycode` module is a third-party dependency used by Node.js and
 * made available to developers as a convenience. Fixes or other modifications to
 * the module must be directed to the [Punycode.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/punycode.js) project.
 * @deprecated

/**
 * The `node:diagnostics_channel` module provides an API to create named channels
 * to report arbitrary message data for diagnostics purposes.
 *
 * It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * import diagnostics_channel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';
 * ```
 *
 * It is intended that a module writer wanting to report diagnostics messages
 * will create one or many top-level channels to report messages through.
 * Channels may also be acquired at runtime but it is not encouraged
 * due to the additional overhead of doing so. Channels may be exported for
 * convenience, but as long as the name is known it can be acquired anywhere.
 *
 * If you intend for your module to produce diagnostics data for others to
 * consume it is recommended that you include documentation of what named
 * channels are used along with the shape of the message data. Channel names
 * should generally include the module name to avoid collisions with data from
 * other modules.

/**
 * The `node:vm` module enables compiling and running code within V8 Virtual

 *
 * **The `node:vm` module is not a security**

 *
 * JavaScript code can be compiled and run immediately or

 *
 * A common use case is to run the code in a different V8 Context. This means
 * invoked code has a different global object than the invoking code.
 *
 * One can provide the context by `contextifying` an
 * object. The invoked code treats any property in the context like a
 * global variable. Any changes to global variables caused by the invoked
 * code are reflected in the context object.
 *
 * ```js
 * const vm = require('node:vm');

 * const x = 1;
 *
 * const context = { x: 2 };
 * vm.createContext(context); // Contextify the object.
 *
 * const code = 'x += 40; var y = 17;';
 * // `x` and `y` are global variables in the context.
 * // Initially, x has the value 2 because that is the value of context.x.

// ./string_decoder.d.ts

/**
 * The `string_decoder` module provides an API for decoding `Buffer` objects into
 * strings in a manner that preserves encoded multi-byte UTF-8 and UTF-16
 * characters. It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { StringDecoder } = require('string_decoder');
 * ```
 *
 * The following example shows the basic use of the `StringDecoder` class.
 *
 * ```js
 * const { StringDecoder } = require('string_decoder');
 * const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
 *
 * const cent = Buffer.from([0xC2, 0xA2]);
 * console.log(decoder.write(cent));
 *
 * const euro = Buffer.from([0xE2, 0x82, 0xAC]);
 * console.log(decoder.write(euro));
 * ```
 *
 * When a `Buffer` instance is written to the `StringDecoder` instance, an
 * internal buffer is used to ensure that the decoded string does not contain
 * any incomplete multibyte characters. These are held in the buffer until the
 * next call to `stringDecoder.write()` or until `stringDecoder.end()` is called.
 *
 * In the following example, the three UTF-8 encoded bytes of the European Euro
 * symbol (`€`) are written over three separate operations:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { StringDecoder } = require('string_decoder');
 * const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
 *
 * decoder.write(Buffer.from([0xE2]));
 * decoder.write(Buffer.from([0x82]));
 * console.log(decoder.end(Buffer.from([0xAC])));
 * ```
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/string_decoder.js)

 * In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js
 * HTTP API is very low-level. It deals with stream handling and message
 * parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not
 * parse the actual headers or the body.
 *
 * See `message.headers` for details on how duplicate headers are handled.
 *
 * The raw headers as they were received are retained in the `rawHeaders`property, which is an array of `[key, value, key2, value2, ...]`. For

  /**
   * An `Agent` is responsible for managing connection persistence
   * and reuse for HTTP clients. It maintains a queue of pending requests
   * for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each
   * until the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed
   * or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the
   * same host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the`keepAlive` `option`.
   *
   * Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may
   * still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the
   * pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for
   * that host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests
   * over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be
   * remade for every request and cannot be pooled. The `Agent` will still make
   * the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.
   *
   * When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed
   * from the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not
   * to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
   * (see `socket.unref()`).
   *
   * It is good practice, to `destroy()` an `Agent` instance when it is no
   * longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.
   *
   * Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either
   * a `'close'` event or an `'agentRemove'` event. When intending to keep one
   * HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something
   * like the following may be done:
   *
   * ```js
   * http.get(options, (res) => {
   *   // Do stuff
   * }).on('socket', (socket) => {
   *   socket.emit('agentRemove');
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing`{agent: false}` as an option to the `http.get()` or `http.request()`functions, a one-time use `Agent` with default options
   * will be used
   * for the client connection.
   *
   * `agent:false`:
   *
   * ```js
   * http.get({
   *   hostname: 'localhost',
   *   port: 80,
   *   path: '/',
   *   agent: false  // Create a new agent just for this one request

   * };
   *
   * const req = http.request(options, (res) => {

   *
   * // Write data to request body
   * req.write(postData);
   * req.end();
   * ```
   *
   * In the example `req.end()` was called. With `http.request()` one
   * must always call `req.end()` to signify the end of the request -
   * even if there is no data being written to the request body.
   *
   * If any error is encountered during the request (be that with DNS resolution,
   * TCP level errors, or actual HTTP parse errors) an `'error'` event is emitted
   * on the returned request object. As with all `'error'` events, if no listeners
   * are registered the error will be thrown.
   *
   * There are a few special headers that should be noted.
   *
   * * Sending a 'Connection: keep-alive' will notify Node.js that the connection to
   * the server should be persisted until the next request.
   * * Sending a 'Content-Length' header will disable the default chunked encoding.
   * * Sending an 'Expect' header will immediately send the request headers.
   * Usually, when sending 'Expect: 100-continue', both a timeout and a listener
   * for the `'continue'` event should be set. See RFC 2616 Section 8.2.3 for more
   * information.
   * * Sending an Authorization header will override using the `auth` option
   * to compute basic authentication.
   *
   * Example using a `URL` as `options`:
   *
   * ```js
   * const options = new URL('http://abc:xyz@example.com');
   *
   * const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
   *   // ...
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * In a successful request, the following events will be emitted in the following
   * order:
   *
   * * `'socket'`
   * * `'response'`
   *    * `'data'` any number of times, on the `res` object
   *    (`'data'` will not be emitted at all if the response body is empty, for

   *    * `'end'` on the `res` object
   * * `'close'`

   * In the case of a connection error, the following events will be emitted:
   *

   * const rl = readline.createInterface({

   *   rl.prompt();
   * }).on('close', () => {
   *   console.log('Have a great day!');
   *   process.exit(0);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Example: Read file stream line-by-Line
   *
   * A common use case for `readline` is to consume an input file one line at a
   * time. The easiest way to do so is leveraging the `fs.ReadStream` API as
   * well as a `for await...of` loop:
   *
   * ```js
   * const fs = require('fs');
   * const readline = require('readline');
   *
   * async function processLineByLine() {
   *   const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   *
   *   const rl = readline.createInterface({
   *     input: fileStream,
   *     crlfDelay: Infinity
   *   });
   *   // Note: we use the crlfDelay option to recognize all instances of CR LF
   *   // ('\r\n') in input.txt as a single line break.
   *
   *   for await (const line of rl) {
   *     // Each line in input.txt will be successively available here as `line`.
   *     console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * processLineByLine();
   * ```
   *
   * Alternatively, one could use the `'line'` event:
   *
   * ```js
   * const fs = require('fs');
   * const readline = require('readline');
   *
   * const rl = readline.createInterface({
   *   input: fs.createReadStream('sample.txt'),
   *   crlfDelay: Infinity
   * });
   *
   * rl.on('line', (line) => {
   *   console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Currently, `for await...of` loop can be a bit slower. If `async` / `await`flow and speed are both essential, a mixed approach can be applied:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { once } = require('events');
   * const { createReadStream } = require('fs');
   * const { createInterface } = require('readline');
   *
   * (async function processLineByLine() {
   *   try {
   *     const rl = createInterface({
   *       input: createReadStream('big-file.txt'),
   *       crlfDelay: Infinity
   *     });
   *
   *     rl.on('line', (line) => {
   *       // Process the line.
   *     });
   *
   *     await once(rl, 'close');
   *
   *     console.log('File processed.');
   *   } catch (err) {
   *     console.error(err);
   *   }
   * })();

   *   process.exit(0);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ## Example: Read file stream line-by-Line
   *
   * A common use case for `readline` is to consume an input file one line at a
   * time. The easiest way to do so is leveraging the `fs.ReadStream` API as
   * well as a `for await...of` loop:
   *
   * ```js
   * const fs = require('fs');
   * const readline = require('readline');
   *
   * async function processLineByLine() {
   *   const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   *
   *   const rl = readline.createInterface({
   *     input: fileStream,
   *     crlfDelay: Infinity
   *   });
   *   // Note: we use the crlfDelay option to recognize all instances of CR LF
   *   // ('\r\n') in input.txt as a single line break.
   *
   *   for await (const line of rl) {
   *     // Each line in input.txt will be successively available here as `line`.
   *     console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * processLineByLine();
   * ```
   *
   * Alternatively, one could use the `'line'` event:
   *
   * ```js
   * const fs = require('fs');
   * const readline = require('readline');
   *
   * const rl = readline.createInterface({
   *   input: fs.createReadStream('sample.txt'),
   *   crlfDelay: Infinity
   * });
   *
   * rl.on('line', (line) => {
   *   console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Currently, `for await...of` loop can be a bit slower. If `async` / `await`flow and speed are both essential, a mixed approach can be applied:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { once } = require('events');
   * const { createReadStream } = require('fs');
   * const { createInterface } = require('readline');
   *
   * (async function processLineByLine() {
   *   try {
   *     const rl = createInterface({
   *       input: createReadStream('big-file.txt'),
   *       crlfDelay: Infinity
   *     });
   *
   *     rl.on('line', (line) => {
   *       // Process the line.
   *     });
   *
   *     await once(rl, 'close');
   *
   *     console.log('File processed.');
   *   } catch (err) {
   *     console.error(err);
   *   }
   * })();
   * ```
   * @since v0.7.7
   * @param callback Invoked once the operation completes.
   * @return `false` if `stream` wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

// ./events.d.ts

/**
 * Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous
 * event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters")
 * emit named events that cause `Function` objects ("listeners") to be called.
 *
 * For instance: a `net.Server` object emits an event each time a peer
 * connects to it; a `fs.ReadStream` emits an event when the file is opened;
 * a `stream` emits an event whenever data is available to be read.
 *
 * All objects that emit events are instances of the `EventEmitter` class. These
 * objects expose an `eventEmitter.on()` function that allows one or more
 * functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object. Typically,
 * event names are camel-cased strings but any valid JavaScript property key
 * can be used.
 *
 * When the `EventEmitter` object emits an event, all of the functions attached
 * to that specific event are called _synchronously_. Any values returned by the
 * called listeners are _ignored_ and discarded.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple `EventEmitter` instance with a single
 * listener. The `eventEmitter.on()` method is used to register listeners, while
 * the `eventEmitter.emit()` method is used to trigger the event.
 *
 * ```js
 * const EventEmitter = require('events');
 *
 * class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
 *
 * const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
 * myEmitter.on('event', () => {
 *   console.log('an event occurred!');
 * });
 * myEmitter.emit('event');
 * ```

     * not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

   * If `allowHalfOpen` is set to `true`, when the other end of the socket
   * signals the end of transmission, the server will only send back the end of
   * transmission when `socket.end()` is explicitly called. For example, in the
   * context of TCP, when a FIN packed is received, a FIN packed is sent
   * back only when `socket.end()` is explicitly called. Until then the
   * connection is half-closed (non-readable but still writable). See `'end'` event and [RFC 1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122) (section 4.2.2.13) for more information.
   *
   * If `pauseOnConnect` is set to `true`, then the socket associated with each
   * incoming connection will be paused, and no data will be read from its handle.
   * This allows connections to be passed between processes without any data being
   * read by the original process. To begin reading data from a paused socket, call `socket.resume()`.
   *

   * on port 8124:

   * const net = require('net');
   * const server = net.createServer((c) => {
   *   // 'connection' listener.
   *   console.log('client connected');
   *   c.on('end', () => {

   * });
   * server.listen(8124, () => {
   *   console.log('server bound');

   * ```
   *
   * Test this by using `telnet`:
   *
   * ```console
   * $ telnet localhost 8124
   * ```
   *

/**
 * The `child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in
 * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
 * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { spawn } = require('child_process');
 * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
 *
 * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.on('close', (code) => {
 *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
 * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
 * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
 * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
 * subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
 * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }`option if the output will not be consumed.
 *
 * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
 * variable if `env` is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
 * used. If `options.env` is set without `PATH`, lookup on Unix is performed
 * on a default search path search of `/usr/bin:/bin` (see your operating system's
 * manual for execvpe/execvp), on Windows the current processes environment
 * variable `PATH` is used.
 *
 * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
 * lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that
 * case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be
 * passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing
 * objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as`PATH` and `Path`.
 *
 * The {@link spawn} method spawns the child process asynchronously,
 * without blocking the Node.js event loop. The {@link spawnSync} function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks
 * the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.
 *
 * For convenience, the `child_process` module provides a handful of synchronous
 * and asynchronous alternatives to {@link spawn} and {@link spawnSync}. Each of these alternatives are implemented on
 * top of {@link spawn} or {@link spawnSync}.
 *
 * * {@link exec}: spawns a shell and runs a command within that
 * shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when
 * complete.
 * * {@link execFile}: similar to {@link exec} except
 * that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by
 * default.
 * * {@link fork}: spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a
 * specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows
 * sending messages between parent and child.
 * * {@link execSync}: a synchronous version of {@link exec} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 * * {@link execFileSync}: a synchronous version of {@link execFile} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 *
 * For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the `synchronous counterparts` may be more convenient. In many cases, however,
 * the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to
 * stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/child_process.js)

     *   console.log('CHILD got message:', m);
     * });
     *
     * // Causes the parent to print: PARENT got message: { foo: 'bar', baz: null }
     * process.send({ foo: 'bar', baz: NaN });
     * ```
     *
     * Child Node.js processes will have a `process.send()` method of their own
     * that allows the child to send messages back to the parent.
     *
     * There is a special case when sending a `{cmd: 'NODE_foo'}` message. Messages
     * containing a `NODE_` prefix in the `cmd` property are reserved for use within
     * Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child's `'message'` event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the`'internalMessage'` event and are consumed internally by Node.js.
     * Applications should avoid using such messages or listening for`'internalMessage'` events as it is subject to change without notice.
     *
     * The optional `sendHandle` argument that may be passed to `subprocess.send()` is
     * for passing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will
     * receive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function
     * registered on the `'message'` event. Any data that is received
     * and buffered in the socket will not be sent to the child.
     *
     * The optional `callback` is a function that is invoked after the message is
     * sent but before the child may have received it. The function is called with a
     * single argument: `null` on success, or an `Error` object on failure.
     *
     * If no `callback` function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an`'error'` event will be emitted by the `ChildProcess` object. This can
     * happen, for instance, when the child process has already exited.
     *
     * `subprocess.send()` will return `false` if the channel has closed or when the
     * backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send
     * more. Otherwise, the method returns `true`. The `callback` function can be
     * used to implement flow control.
     *
     * #### Example: sending a server object
     *
     * The `sendHandle` argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of
     * a TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:
     *
     * ```js
     * const subprocess = require('child_process').fork('subprocess.js');
     *
     * // Open up the server object and send the handle.
     * const server = require('net').createServer();
     * server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     *   socket.end('handled by parent');
     * });
     * server.listen(1337, () => {
     *   subprocess.send('server', server);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * The child would then receive the server object as:
     *
     * ```js
     * process.on('message', (m, server) => {
     *   if (m === 'server') {
     *     server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     *       socket.end('handled by child');
     *     });
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Once the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections
     * can be handled by the parent and some by the child.
     *
     * While the example above uses a server created using the `net` module, `dgram`module servers use exactly the same workflow with the exceptions of listening on
     * a `'message'` event instead of `'connection'` and using `server.bind()` instead
     * of `server.listen()`. This is, however, currently only supported on Unix
     * platforms.
     *
     * #### Example: sending a socket object
     *
     * Similarly, the `sendHandler` argument can be used to pass the handle of a
     * socket to the child process. The example below spawns two children that each
     * handle connections with "normal" or "special" priority:
     *
     * ```js
     * const { fork } = require('child_process');
     * const normal = fork('subprocess.js', ['normal']);
     * const special = fork('subprocess.js', ['special']);
     *
     * // Open up the server and send sockets to child. Use pauseOnConnect to prevent
     * // the sockets from being read before they are sent to the child process.
     * const server = require('net').createServer({ pauseOnConnect: true });
     * server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     *
     *   // If this is special priority...
     *   if (socket.remoteAddress === '74.125.127.100') {
     *     special.send('socket', socket);
     *     return;
     *   }
     *   // This is normal priority.
     *   normal.send('socket', socket);
     * });
     * server.listen(1337);
     * ```
     *
     * The `subprocess.js` would receive the socket handle as the second argument
     * passed to the event callback function:
     *
     * ```js
     * process.on('message', (m, socket) => {
     *   if (m === 'socket') {
     *     if (socket) {
     *       // Check that the client socket exists.
     *       // It is possible for the socket to be closed between the time it is
     *       // sent and the time it is received in the child process.
     *       socket.end(`Request handled with ${process.argv[2]} priority`);
     *     }
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Do not use `.maxConnections` on a socket that has been passed to a subprocess.
     * The parent cannot track when the socket is destroyed.
     *
     * Any `'message'` handlers in the subprocess should verify that `socket` exists,
     * as the connection may have been closed during the time it takes to send the
     * connection to the child.
     * @since v0.5.9

   * ```
   *
   * Use `cwd` to specify the working directory from which the process is spawned.
   * If not given, the default is to inherit the current working directory. If given,
   * but the path does not exist, the child process emits an `ENOENT` error
   * and exits immediately. `ENOENT` is also emitted when the command
   * does not exist.
   *
   * Use `env` to specify environment variables that will be visible to the new

   *
   * `undefined` values in `env` will be ignored.
   *
   * Example of running `ls -lh /usr`, capturing `stdout`, `stderr`, and the

   *   if (code !== 0) {
   *     console.log(`grep process exited with code ${code}`);
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Example of checking for failed `spawn`:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { spawn } = require('child_process');
   * const subprocess = spawn('bad_command');
   *
   * subprocess.on('error', (err) => {
   *   console.error('Failed to start subprocess.');
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Certain platforms (macOS, Linux) will use the value of `argv[0]` for the process
   * title while others (Windows, SunOS) will use `command`.
   *
   * Node.js currently overwrites `argv[0]` with `process.execPath` on startup, so`process.argv[0]` in a Node.js child process will not match the `argv0`parameter passed to `spawn` from the parent,
   * retrieve it with the`process.argv0` property instead.
   *
   * If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding`AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except
   * the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { spawn } = require('child_process');
   * const controller = new AbortController();
   * const { signal } = controller;
   * const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh'], { signal });
   * grep.on('error', (err) => {
   *   // This will be called with err being an AbortError if the controller aborts
   * });
   * controller.abort(); // Stops the child process
   * ```

   * Spawns a shell then executes the `command` within that shell, buffering any
   * generated output. The `command` string passed to the exec function is processed
   * directly by the shell and special characters (vary based on [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters))
   * need to be dealt with accordingly:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { exec } = require('child_process');
   *
   * exec('"/path/to/test file/test.sh" arg1 arg2');
   * // Double quotes are used so that the space in the path is not interpreted as
   * // a delimiter of multiple arguments.
   *
   * exec('echo "The \\$HOME variable is $HOME"');
   * // The $HOME variable is escaped in the first instance, but not in the second.
   * ```
   *
   * **Never pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell**
   * **metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**
   *
   * If a `callback` function is provided, it is called with the arguments`(error, stdout, stderr)`. On success, `error` will be `null`. On error,`error` will be an instance of `Error`. The
   * `error.code` property will be
   * the exit code of the process. By convention, any exit code other than `0`indicates an error. `error.signal` will be the signal that terminated the
   * process.
   *
   * The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the
   * stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode
   * the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option
   * can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and
   * stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character
   * encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.
   *
   * ```js
   * const { exec } = require('child_process');
   * exec('cat *.js missing_file | wc -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
   *   if (error) {
   *     console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
   *     return;
   *   }
   *   console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
   *   console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * If `timeout` is greater than `0`, the parent will send the signal
   * identified by the `killSignal` property (the default is `'SIGTERM'`) if the
   * child runs longer than `timeout` milliseconds.
   *
   * Unlike the [`exec(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.exec()` does not replace
   * the existing process and uses a shell to execute the command.
   *
   * If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, it returns
   * a `Promise` for an `Object` with `stdout` and `stderr` properties. The returned`ChildProcess` instance is attached to the `Promise` as a `child` property. In
   * case of an error (including any error resulting in an exit code other than 0), a
   * rejected promise is returned, with the same `error` object given in the
   * callback, but with two additional properties `stdout` and `stderr`.
   *
   * ```js
   * const util = require('util');
   * const exec = util.promisify(require('child_process').exec);
   *
   * async function lsExample() {
   *   const { stdout, stderr } = await exec('ls');
   *   console.log('stdout:', stdout);
   *   console.error('stderr:', stderr);
   * }
   * lsExample();
   * ```
   *
   * If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding`AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except
   * the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:
   *
   * ```js
   * const { exec } = require('child_process');
   * const controller = new AbortController();
   * const { signal } = controller;
   * const child = exec('grep ssh', { signal }, (error) => {
   *   console.log(error); // an AbortError
   * });
   * controller.abort();
   * ```
   * @since v0.1.90
   * @param command The command to run, with space-separated arguments.
   * @param callback called with the output when process terminates.

   * The `child_process.fork()` method is a special case of {@link spawn} used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes.
   * Like {@link spawn}, a `ChildProcess` object is returned. The
   * returned `ChildProcess` will have an additional communication channel
   * built-in that allows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and
   * child. See `subprocess.send()` for details.
   *
   * Keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are
   * independent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel
   * that is established between the two. Each process has its own memory, with
   * their own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations
   * required, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not
   * recommended.
   *
   * By default, `child_process.fork()` will spawn new Node.js instances using the `process.execPath` of the parent process. The `execPath` property in the`options` object allows for an alternative
   * execution path to be used.
   *
   * Node.js processes launched with a custom `execPath` will communicate with the
   * parent process using the file descriptor (fd) identified using the
   * environment variable `NODE_CHANNEL_FD` on the child process.
   *
   * Unlike the [`fork(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.fork()` does not clone the
   * current process.
   *
   * The `shell` option available in {@link spawn} is not supported by`child_process.fork()` and will be ignored if set.
   *
   * If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding`AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except
   * the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:
   *
   * ```js

   * function [`EVP_BytesToKey`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html) with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one
   * iteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same
   * password always creates the same key. The low iteration count and
   * non-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very
   * rapidly.
   *
   * In line with OpenSSL's recommendation to use a more modern algorithm instead of [`EVP_BytesToKey`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/EVP_BytesToKey.html) it is recommended that
   * developers derive a key and IV on
   * their own using {@link scrypt} and to use {@link createDecipheriv} to create the `Decipher` object.
   * @deprecated Since v10.0.0 - Use {@link createDecipheriv} instead.

   * authentication tag in bytes, see `CCM mode`. In GCM mode, the `authTagLength`option is not required but can be used to restrict accepted authentication tags
   * to those with the specified length.
   * For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.
   *
   * The `algorithm` is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are `'aes192'`, etc. On
   * recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` will
   * display the available cipher algorithms.
   *
   * The `key` is the raw key used by the `algorithm` and `iv` is an [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector). Both arguments must be `'utf8'` encoded
   * strings,`Buffers`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView`s. The `key` may optionally be
   * a `KeyObject` of type `secret`. If the cipher does not need
   * an initialization vector, `iv` may be `null`.
   *
   * When passing strings for `key` or `iv`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.
   *
   * Initialization vectors should be unpredictable and unique; ideally, they will be
   * cryptographically random. They do not have to be secret: IVs are typically just
   * added to ciphertext messages unencrypted. It may sound contradictory that

   * * As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted

   * The {@link createDecipher} or {@link createDecipheriv} methods are
   * used to create `Decipher` instances. `Decipher` objects are not to be created
   * directly using the `new` keyword.
   *
   * Example: Using `Decipher` objects as streams:
   *
   * ```js
   * import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
   * const {
   *   scryptSync,
   *   createDecipheriv
   * } = await import('crypto');
   *
   * const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';

   * // 24 bytes (192 bits).
   * // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
   * const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
   * // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
   * const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

   * decipher.on('end', () => {
   *   console.log(decrypted);
   *   // Prints: some clear text data

   *
   * // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
   * const encrypted =

   * decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
   * decipher.end();
   * ```
   *

  /**
   * Generates a new asymmetric key pair of the given `type`. RSA, RSA-PSS, DSA, EC,
   * Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448, and DH are currently supported.
   *
   * If a `publicKeyEncoding` or `privateKeyEncoding` was specified, this function
   * behaves as if `keyObject.export()` had been called on its result. Otherwise,
   * the respective part of the key is returned as a `KeyObject`.
   *
   * It is recommended to encode public keys as `'spki'` and private keys as`'pkcs8'` with encryption for long-term storage:
   *
   * ```js
   * const {
   *   generateKeyPair
   * } = await import('crypto');
   *
   * generateKeyPair('rsa', {
   *   modulusLength: 4096,
   *   publicKeyEncoding: {
   *     type: 'spki',
   *     format: 'pem'
   *   },
   *   privateKeyEncoding: {
   *     type: 'pkcs8',
   *     format: 'pem',
   *     cipher: 'aes-256-cbc',
   *     passphrase: 'top secret'
   *   }
   * }, (err, publicKey, privateKey) => {
   *   // Handle errors and use the generated key pair.
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * On completion, `callback` will be called with `err` set to `undefined` and`publicKey` / `privateKey` representing the generated key pair.
   *
   * If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, it returns
   * a `Promise` for an `Object` with `publicKey` and `privateKey` properties.
   * @param type Must be `'rsa'`, `'rsa-pss'`, `'dsa'`, `'ec'`, `'ed25519'`, `'ed448'`, `'x25519'`, `'x448'`, or `'dh'`.

   *
   * ```js
   * import { createReadStream } from 'fs';

   * // Create a stream from some character device.
   * const stream = createReadStream('/dev/input/event0');

   *   // Artificially marking end-of-stream, as if the underlying resource had
   *   // indicated end-of-file by itself, allows the stream to close.
   *   // This does not cancel pending read operations, and if there is such an
   *   // operation, the process may still not be able to exit successfully
   *   // until it finishes.
